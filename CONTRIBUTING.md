# Contributing

Want to contribute to Scorify? That would be excellent. The project maintainer (Nate Vack) is not available for massive amounts of help, but can spend some time to help you get started working, and ultimately do things like review pull requests. This is his first experience in this sort of thing, so it'll be a learning process for him as well as you.

Things we currently need help with:

* Cleaning up scripts/score_data.py so it isn't so terrible-looking
* Clear examples of data, scoresheet, and resulting output
* Better, more readable documentation (probably partly with the above) that doesn't look like it's written for programmers.
